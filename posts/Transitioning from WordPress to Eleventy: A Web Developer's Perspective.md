# Transitioning from WordPress to Eleventy: A Web Developer's Perspective

As a web developer, I've spent countless hours crafting websites using various content management systems (CMS), including WordPress. While WordPress undoubtedly offers a user-friendly interface and a vast repository of plugins, I've come to realize that its complexity can hinder the creative process and limit the flexibility of website design. This led me to explore static site generators (SSGs), and Eleventy quickly emerged as the frontrunner.

Eleventy's simplicity and intuitive syntax have made it a refreshing change from the intricacies of WordPress. Its Liquid-like templating engine allows me to focus on the content and structure of my website without getting bogged down in configuration and maintenance. Additionally, Eleventy's plugin ecosystem provides a wealth of extensions that enhance its capabilities, further expanding my creative freedom.

One of the key reasons I'm drawn to Eleventy is its ability to deliver blazing-fast page load times. This is a crucial aspect of modern web development, as it directly impacts user experience and search engine optimization (SEO). By generating static HTML files during the build process, Eleventy eliminates the need for server-side rendering, ensuring that pages load instantly regardless of the visitor's location or device.

Another compelling factor is Eleventy's compatibility with Content Management Systems (CMS). While I prefer the direct control and flexibility of SSGs, there may be instances where a CMS is necessary to manage complex content structures or collaborate with non-technical team members. Eleventy seamlessly integrates with popular CMS systems like Contentful and Strapi, allowing me to leverage their strengths while maintaining the simplicity of building with Eleventy.

To kick off my transition to Eleventy, I've decided to create my CV as a web page. This aligns well with my web development background and provides a tangible example of my skills. Plus, HTML was originally designed to describe documents, making it an ideal choice for presenting my professional profile.

By converting my CV to a web page, I've not only enhanced its visual appeal but also made it easily sharable across various platforms. Additionally, browsers' built-in printing functionality ensures that I can easily generate paper copies of my CV whenever needed.

As I delve deeper into Eleventy, I'm excited to explore its potential for building more complex and engaging websites. Its simplicity, flexibility, and performance make it an ideal choice for a web developer like me who seeks a streamlined and creative development experience.
